DeText Training Manual
==========

## Training data format and preparation

DeText uses TFRecords format for training data.  In general, the input data should have:
* One field for "query" with name `query`
* One field for "wide features" with name `wide_ftrs`
* Multiple fields for "document fields" with name `doc_<field name>`
* One field for "labels" with name `label`

We show an example of the prepared training data and explain the data format and shapes. 
* `query` (string list containing only 1 string)
    * For each training sample, there should be 1 query field.
    * eg. ["how do you del ##ete messages"]
* `wide_ftrs` (float list) 
    * There could be multiple wide features for each document. Therefore the wide features are really a 2-D array with shape [#documents, #wide features per document]. Since TFRecords support 1-D FloatList, we flatten the wide features in the preparation and transform to grouped features in `train/data_fn.py` by reshaping. Therefore the float list of wide_ftrs in the training data has `#documents * #wide features per document = 10 * 3 = 30` entries.
    * [0.305 0.264 0.180 0.192 0.136 0.027 0.273 0.273 0.377 0.233 0.264 0.227 0.119 0.119 0.198 0.212 0.274 0.047 0.320 0.255 0.350 0.000 0.000 0.357 0.301 0.367 0.292 0.000 0.000 0.170]
* `label` (float list)
    * The labels corresponding to each document. In our example, 0 for documents without any click and 1 for documents with clicks.
    * [0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
* `doc_titles` (string list)
    * Document text fields. The shape should be the same as label. There could be multiple doc_fields in the data. For example, we could also include a doc_description as a feature. If multiple doc_fields are present, the interaction features will be computed for each query-doc pair. 
    * ["creating a linked ##in group", "edit your profile"...]


## Customizing and training a DeText model

The following example (from [run_detext.sh](src/detext/resources/run_detext.sh)) shows how you could train a DeText CNN model for a search ranking task. 

The train/dev/test datasets are prepared in the format mentioned in the previous section. More specifically, the following fields are used:
* `query`
* `wide_ftrs`
* `doc_titles`
* `label`

The DeText model will extract deep features using the CNN module from both `query` and `doc_titles`. After the text representation, cosine similarity interaction feature between the two fields is computed. The interaction score is then concatenated with the `wide_ftrs`. A dense hidden layer is added before computing the final LTR score.

The following script is used for running the DeText training. 
```bash
python run_detext.py \
--ftr_ext=cnn \ # deep module is CNN
--feature_names=query,label,wide_ftrs,doc_title \   # list all the feature names in the data
--learning_rate=0.001 \
--ltr=softmax \ # type of ltr loss
--max_len=32 \  # sentence max length
--min_len=3 \   # sentence min length
--num_fields=1 \    # the number of document fields (starting with 'doc_') used
--filter_window_sizes=2,3 \   # CNN filter sizes. Could be a list of different sizes.
--num_filters=50 \  # number of filters in CNN
--num_hidden=100 \  # size of hidden layer after the interaction layer
--num_train_steps=10 \
--num_units=32 \    # word embedding size
--num_wide=10 \     # number of wide features per document
--optimizer=bert_adam \
--pmetric=ndcg@10 \     primary metric. This is used for evaluation during training. Best models are kept according to this metric.
--random_seed=11 \
--steps_per_stats=1 \
--steps_per_eval=2 \
--test_batch_size=2 \
--train_batch_size=2 \
--use_wide=True \   # whether to use wide_ftrs
--use_deep=True \   # whether to use the text features
--dev_file=hc_examples.tfrecord \
--test_file=hc_examples.tfrecord \
--train_file=hc_examples.tfrecord \
--vocab_file=vocab.txt \
--out_dir=detext-output/hc_cnn_f50_u32_h100 \
